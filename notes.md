# UI/UX

## 1st page

Highlight the candidate choice ?
Should be more candidates than agents
Might be intersting to look for a more transparent way to connect for agents, can use cookies to remember last connection and highlight the best choice ?

## Form

### 2nd page

Change dynamically the text "Rejoignez des milliers de locataires [...]" if you connect as an agent

### OTP

Look to how does apple smart autocomplete work

### More info

Where does the return button go? Do we already save the info?
